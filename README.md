## Development

To start writing code create a new branch, name it based on the task eg. feature/login, bug/auth or feature/register

1. Use camelCase as the naming convention throughout the project, even for the filenames & folders
2. Icons - use the icons in the elements
3. Use the CSS variables in the `index.scss` for;
   1. Colors
   2. Border Radius
   3. Fonts

### Opening a PR

1. Make sure to mention the issue you were working on eg closes #1 or closes #3
2. Make sure your branch does not have any conflicts with the main branch

### To Do

1. Remove event comp if not reused
2. Update permissions
